# K-Means-clustering-and-PCA-Principal-Component-Analysis-
In the first part of the project I implemented the K-Means clustering algorithm and applied it to compress an image.
Finally I also implemented the principal component analysis algorithm to find a low dimensional representation of face images. 
This project was part of the required projects for Stanford University's Introduction to machine learning on coursera.com.
It was implemented in the GNU octave programming language and was graded a 100% by the course instructors
